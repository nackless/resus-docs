**Definition**: Life threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. [^1]

## Septic Shock

> Sepsis leading to vasodilatory hypotension below a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg and lactate level > 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) despite adequate fluid resuscitation and is associated with increased mortality (> 40%).

- Sepsis occurs when host response to life threatening infectious pathogen causes organ dysfunction, as manifested by

  - Increase in sofa score >= 2.[^2]

- Gram positive sepsis seems to be the most common cause in US
- Any patient suspected of having sepsis should be evaluated for source of infection.

Management

- Rapid delivery of care and frequent assessments
- Immediate management (within 10-15 minutes)
  - Assess septic shock - in patient with SIRS
    - SBP < 90 or MAP < 65
    - End organ hypoperfusion
      - Altered mental status
      - tacyypnea
        - without hypoxia
        - with hypoxia
      - tachycardia
      - dec urine output
      - delayed capillary refill time
  - Obtain diagnostic testing
    - Blood test - FBC, U&Es, creatinine, liver function tests, amylase, clotting, blood gas
    - urinalysis and urine culture
    - sputum gram stain and culture
- Early management (within 1 hour)
- Resuscitation phase (first 6 hours)
